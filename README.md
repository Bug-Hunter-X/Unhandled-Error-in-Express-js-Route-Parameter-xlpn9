# Express.js Unhandled Route Parameter Error

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js route handlers: failure to handle invalid or missing parameters.  The `bug.js` file shows the problematic code, while `bugSolution.js` provides a corrected version.

The issue arises when a route parameter (e.g., user ID) is not properly validated or checked before being used. This can lead to database errors, unexpected crashes, or even security vulnerabilities if the invalid input is used in an unsafe way.

The solution involves adding robust error handling and input validation to prevent these issues.  Best practices include using middleware for parameter validation and handling potential exceptions.
